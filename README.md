# shareNetWithCrossEth

Own public cheat sheet

To share network over LAN You need crossed Ethernet cable (You can find what it do in www) and two computer (PC, laptop, other who have eth sock).


PC 1# who share net and have net connection
PC 2# who need network


In Windows:
1# IP 192.168.0.1/24; gateway 192.168.0.2

WITHOUT DNS


2# IP 192.168.0.2/24; gateway 192.168.0.1

Dns first 192.168.0.1; alternative 8.8.8.8 (Google dns for best performance üëç)


Thats all, if not working reboot client or/and "sharever"
